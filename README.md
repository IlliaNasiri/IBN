**Replication**
To replicate this code, you need to install:
1. **LINUX ONLY**: A linux machine, or virtual machine like** WSL**. This is because validate.sh runs only in linux.
2. **Docker**
3. In terminal, run ```pip install groq```
5. In terminal run ```python main.py ```
6. Enter the intent
7. **NOTE:** for your convenience, I'm giving you my Groq API key. But you can use yours if you want.
